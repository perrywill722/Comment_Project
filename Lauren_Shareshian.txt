During this semester of Comp Sci, we covered topics of dictionaries, lists, and tuples. We will continue to expand our knowledge of these topics in the second semester. Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Lauren Shareshian has been a wonderful student to have this year.She communicated with other students fairly well. This demonstrates that she knows how to work with other students in class and on projects. However, she should work a bit more on talking with other students. With a score of 90%, she clearly put in a great effort on her homework to come to class prepared each day. Keep up the strong work! Lauren Shareshian has shown mastery and understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. With an astounding 95.0% average, she is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Lauren Shareshian was a joy to have this year. She has excelled throughout my course and has only almost no improvements to make. Her final grade is 96, resulting in an A.
