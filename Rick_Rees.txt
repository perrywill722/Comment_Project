During this semester of Comp Sci, we covered topics of dictionaries, lists, and tuples. We will continue to expand our knowledge of these topics in the second semester. Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Rick Rees has been a wonderful student to have this year.He communicated with other students fairly well. This demonstrates that he knows how to work with other students in class and on projects. However, he should work a bit more on talking with other students. With a score of 85%, he clearly put in an adequate effort on his homework to come to class prepared each day. There's room for improvement here, but keep up the good work! Rick Rees has shown understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. However, they will need to work even harder to learn the following topics in the next semester. With an 80.0% average, he is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Rick Rees was a joy to have this year. He has met expectations, but has been challenged at times. His final grade is 82, resulting in a B-.
