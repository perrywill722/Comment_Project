During this semester of Comp Sci, we covered topics of dictionaries, lists, and tuples. We will continue to expand our knowledge of these topics in the second semester. Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Matt Pigg has been a wonderful student to have this year.He communicated with other students fairly well. This demonstrates that he knows how to work with other students in class and on projects. However, he should work a bit more on talking with other students. With a score of 100%, he clearly put in a great effort on his homework to come to class prepared each day. Keep up the strong work! Matt Pigg has shown partial understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. With an 88.3% average, he is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Matt Pigg was a joy to have this year. He has found success throughout my course, and has only a few improvements to make. His final grade is 90, resulting in an A-.
