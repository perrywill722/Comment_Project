During this semester of Comp Sci, we covered topics of dictionaries, lists, and tuples. We will continue to expand our knowledge of these topics in the second semester. Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Dennis Chang has been a wonderful student to have this year.He communicated poorly with other students and did not talk with other students much. This demonstrates that he needs to work with other students in class and on projects much better. With a score of 96%, he clearly put in a great effort on his homework to come to class prepared each day. Keep up the strong work! Dennis Chang has shown mastery and understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. With an astounding 94.7% average, he is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Dennis Chang was a joy to have this year. He has excelled throughout my course and has only almost no improvements to make. His final grade is 96, resulting in an A.
