During this semester of Comp Sci, we covered topics of dictionaries, lists, and tuples. We will continue to expand our knowledge of these topics in the second semester. Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Asha Appel has been a wonderful student to have this year.She communicated poorly with other students and did not talk with other students much. This demonstrates that she needs to work with other students in class and on projects much better. With a score of 83%, she clearly put in an adequate effort on her homework to come to class prepared each day. There's room for improvement here, but keep up the good work! Asha Appel has shown partial understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. With an 82.0% average, she is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Asha Appel was a joy to have this year. She has met expectations, but has been challenged at times. Her final grade is 83, resulting in a B-.
