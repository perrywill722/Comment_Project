Also, we will use these topics for a final project at the end of the school year. In this semester, we have had daily homework, many problem sets, and exams. The students have taken two smaller exams and one final exam. They also have done a project using what they learned in this class based on creating a working bank. Bevin Daglen has been a wonderful student to have this year.She communicated with other students fairly well. This demonstrates that she knows how to work with other students in class and on projects. However, she should work a bit more on talking with other students. With a score of 72%, she could improve her homework grade. It is very important to come to class prepared each day, and doing homework is part of that. If you ever have any questions about the content, I am here to help! Bevin Daglen has shown understanding of the subjects shown in this class through exams. However, they will need to work even harder to learn the following topics in the next semester. With an 80.0% average, she is sure to become even more successful throughout the next semester. Bevin Daglen was a joy to have this year. She has met expectations, but has been challenged at times. Her final grade is 80, resulting in a B-.
